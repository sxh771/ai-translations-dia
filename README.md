# Proof of Concept for AI-Powered Translation

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the code for a "Proof of Concept for AI-Powered Translation". The application showcases the capabilities of modern AI technologies in language detection, translation, and speech synthesis using Azure Cognitive Services. This proof of concept is designed to demonstrate the potential for implementing these technologies in real-world applications, highlighting their efficiency and accuracy.

## Description

This application is a robust Flask-based web service designed for advanced language processing tasks. It utilizes a range of Azure Cognitive Services for functionalities such as language detection, text translation, and speech synthesis. Additionally, it integrates with Azure Blob Storage for document management and extracts text from PDF and DOCX files using PyMuPDF and `docx2txt`.

## Key Features

- **Language Detection and Translation**: Leverages Azure Translation to automatically detect the language of the provided text and translates it to a specified target language with high accuracy.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Uses Azure Speech SDK to convert text to natural-sounding speech, supporting multiple languages and dialects with various voice options.
- **File Handling**: Capable of handling file uploads securely, extracting text from different document formats, and saving synthesized audio files locally.
- **Logging and Error Handling**: Implements a sophisticated logging system that tracks operations, system status, and errors. The logs are managed through a rotating file system that ensures log files are kept under control in size and number.
- **Session and Request Management**: Incorporates session management for state persistence across requests and employs Flask middleware for performance profiling and error handling.

## Configuration and Setup

1. **Dependencies**: Install all the necessary libraries and packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file to ensure the application functions correctly.
   
2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Translation and speech services keys and endpoints such as `AZURE_TRANSLATION_KEY`, `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`, and their respective regions and endpoints.
   - Database credentials like `DB_SERVER` and `DB_USERNAME` to connect to the SQL database.
   - Azure Blob Storage configuration including `BLOB_CONNECTION_STRING` and `BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME`.

3. **Database Setup**: Execute the SQL commands provided in the script to configure the necessary tables and indexes in your SQL database, ensuring data integrity and optimized access.

4. **Logging**: Configure the path and settings for the `app.log` file to capture detailed logs. Adjust the logging level as necessary for different environments.

5. **Running the Application**: Execute the application using the Flask built-in server for development by running `flask run`. For production environments, consider using a more robust WSGI server like Gunicorn.
